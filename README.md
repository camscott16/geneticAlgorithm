# geneticAlgorithm

This is a simple model of a modern genetic algorithm. Genetic Algorithms are a type of evolutionary algorithm utilized to generate high-quality solutions to search and optimization problems.
They rely on 3 basic operators:
	- mutation
	- crossover
	- selection

This is a small and basic idea of genetic algorithms but feel free to check it out

There is one file genAl.cpp which can be downloaded and ran on any system containing c++11
