# geneticAlgorithm

This is a simple model of a modern genetic algorithm. Genetic Algorithms are a type of evolutionary algorithm utilized to generate high-quality solutions to search and optimization problems.
They rely on 3 basic operators:
  - mutation
  - crossover
  - selection

This is a small and basic idea of genetic algorithms that generates solutions based off of random generated data

There is one file ga.cpp which can be downloaded and ran, just remember to compile with c++11
